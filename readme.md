# Notion-Blog

Forked from [transitive-bullshit/nextjs-notion-starter-kit](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/nextjs-notion-starter-kit)

> [!NOTE]
> This repo has been publicly archived. 
> You can still visit my [blog](https://notion-blog-pearl-psi.vercel.app/) that using starter-kit, but no more updates.
> starter-kit is a good tool, but some content (e.g. mention) can not be rendered properly, and I think notion native page is good enough now. So I switch back to the notion native page.
